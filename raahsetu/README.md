# raahsetu

RaahSetu is an Android-based safety application designed to provide quick assistance during emergencies such as accidents, harassment, or medical crises. The app allows users to send instant SOS alerts to nearby people using real-time notifications and location-based services. By leveraging Firebase, Google Maps API, and push notifications, RaahSetu creates a community-driven safety network where individuals can respond promptly, reducing response time and potentially saving lives.
